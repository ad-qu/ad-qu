## About Me 😎

<p align="justify"> I'm Adrián, a recent graduate in Network Engineering and Internet Technologies who discovered a passion for software development and engineering. My journey into this field was sparked by several development projects I completed during my studies at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia, where I earned my degree. Through these projects, I explored various technologies, culminating in my final student project: a modern mobile application built with Flutter, powered by a Node.js server in TypeScript, and using MongoDB. This app allowed university campus users to explore and discover communities within the campus. For more details, you can check out the repositories: </p>
