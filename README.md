### 👋 About Me

<p align="justify">
I'm <strong>Adrián</strong>, a software developer and telecommunications engineer specialized in <strong>Network Engineering and Internet Technologies</strong>.  
I currently work on <strong>industrial digitalization</strong> and <strong>Industry 4.0</strong> projects, building software solutions that connect production systems with reliable and usable data.

My background includes extensive work with different programming languages and software technologies, which now supports my focus on industrial environments, data integration, and real-time systems. I enjoy working on projects where software engineering and industrial operations meet, especially when well-designed tools can simplify complex processes and improve day-to-day work on the shop floor.

### 🏭 Industry 4.0 & Industrial Systems

In my current role, I design and develop monitoring and data integration solutions for manufacturing environments using <strong>AspenTech Inmation</strong>. My work involves:

- Integrating industrial equipment and heterogeneous data sources  
- Building real-time monitoring platforms and operational dashboards  
- Developing backend logic in Lua to process data and define system behavior  
- Supporting system monitoring, configuration management, and data migration processes  

The goal is always the same: transform raw operational data into clear, reliable information that production teams can actually use.
